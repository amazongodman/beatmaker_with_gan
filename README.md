# beatmaker_with_gan

Generate beats used in freestyle rap from deep learning.  

DCGAN learned the beat of the 8-bar 196 song.  

try8 uses relu in the final layer of beat generation.  
try9 uses leakyrelu in the final layer of beat generation.  

DCGAN was created from the official keras documentation.  
We do not plan to release the code, but the network structure is available in each folder.
